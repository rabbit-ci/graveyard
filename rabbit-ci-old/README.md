# Rabbit CI
_An ultra-fast polyglot CI system._

NOTE: Active development of Rabbit CI is mostly in https://github.com/rabbit-ci/backend/.

**What is Rabbit CI?**
Rabbit CI is the future of everything. Eventually it will wash your
cat, take out the trash, and even make your lattes. But right now it
does very little. Let's break down the subheader to see what it is:

_An_ -- indefinite article

_ultra-fast_ -- [Rapto-velocity](http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Rapto-velocity)

_polyglot_ -- Written in many languages

_CI_ -- [Continuous Integration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration)

_system_ -- A set of connected things or parts forming a complex whole

A better explanation will be added later, for now just tell you
friends how cool it is.

## What is this repo?
This repo is a central resource for Rabbit CI related things. RFCs
will be posted here. If you have questions, you can ask them by
creating a new issue (this will be replaced by our own StackExchange
site once we rule the world).

## How do I get started?
You don't. Rabbit CI is not ready to overthrow Jenkins and other
devilish CI servers. But when it is, we'll update this page.

Right now you can help by contributing to one of the components of
Rabbit CI. You can find a list of those by looking at the
[organization's GitHub page.](https://github.com/rabbit-ci)

## But what's wrong with Jenkins?
If you don't know already you're not worthy enough to use Rabbit
CI. Be gone evil spirits! (I'll put an actual reason here once I have
something presentable.)
